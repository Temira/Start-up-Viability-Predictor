# Applications of Machine Learning Final Project

#### The goal of my project is to use data to predict the viability or future success of a start-up.
The business purpose of my project is to provide validation for investing in start-ups. I do not anticipate that my model alone will be enough to justify an investment, but it can help justify an investment and boost confidence in the outcome of an investment. It will hopefully be explainable in a way that can help explain the investment to LPs or other people that will be holding the investors accountable. I used a dataset of almost 50k startups and their funding processes and whether or not they currently exist today. This information was cross-referenced with the CPIs on the dates of important "life-cycle" events of the start-ups. (Such as the date when they were founded, when they raised their first round of funding, and when they raised their last round of funding.) This model is clearly far from perfect. If I had more time I would implement more ways to get rid of the inherent imbalance in the dataset.
